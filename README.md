# tic_tac_toe
The odin project tic tac toe terminal project
My approach to completing this project was based on the traditional method of the game
This requires input from to users. In this scenario the move of one player is automated
which is the computer and the othe requires input from another user
I have tested it many times to accomodate for bad user input and many winning patterns
have fun
